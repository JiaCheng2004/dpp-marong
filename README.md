### Personal Voice Channel on Discord
This feature allows dynamic automatic channel name changes on the Discord server, specifically with voice channels, which creates a unique and personable experience for server members. It significantly provides a tailored, personal touch to members of a Discord server on voice channels. With this feature, every time a member joins a voice channel, the name of the channel is automatIcally transformed into their personal preset channel name. If not preset, the default name is used. 

The name that gets displayed as the Discord voice channel is decided based on priority. The highest-prioritized member's name gets set to the voice channel. This enhances navigation, as users can easily identify the channel based on the name of the most prioritized member present. 

Once a member exits the channel, the name transformation is not permanent. The channel name dynamically reverts back to its original state prior to the user's joining. This dynamicity contributes to a seamless and intuitive user interface on Discord, enriching the customization experience for users. 

Through the Dynamic Voice Channel Name feature, Discord adds a unique sense of personal touch and responsibility to their voice channels, making server navigation and interaction more engaging and user friendly.
